# mentions
A user @mention plugin for e107 CMS.

![mentions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/315195/28443458-307b897a-6dc7-11e7-981f-1ecc3f64c5d8.gif)

# Description
A plugin that converts user mentions (usernames prepended with '@' sign) in comments, chatbox posts, and forum posts to matching user-profile links in your e107 powered websites. It also helpfully renders a username autocompletion/suggestion popup-list as a user starts to type a username followed by '@' sign in textboxes.

# Contributions
Community contributions to mentions plugin are welcome. Since the project is still in beta there are specific priorities for development right now. Please take a look at project [roadmap](https://github.com/arunshekher/mentions/projects/1 "Mentions Roadmap") before contributing via issues and pull requests.

# Ways to contribute
* Find bugs and file issues
* Submit pull requests - fix errors, squash bugs, refactor for performance, write language packs
* Submit feature requests
* Express gratitude - scientific studies continually prove that showing appreciation/gratitude to others can make you happier :wink: :laughing: :heart_eyes:

# Known Bugs
1. When the forum title has a word prepended with an '@' sign in it, it causes rendering issues to the rest of the forum thread, sometimes (some replies in the thread go missing!). As soon as the @ sign is removed or a space added in between by editing the forum title all replies in the thread renders properly. At present I'm at a loss for a fix.
